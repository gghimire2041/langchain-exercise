# Introduction

**LangChain** is a framework designed for developing applications empowered by language models. It facilitates the creation of applications that possess the following capabilities:

- **Context-Awareness:** Connecting a language model to sources of context (such as prompt instructions, few-shot examples, content to ground its response in, etc.).
- **Reasoning:** Relying on a language model to reason, determining how to respond based on the provided context, deciding on actions to take, etc.

This framework comprises several integral components:

1. **LangChain Libraries:** 
    - Includes Python and JavaScript libraries.
    - Contains interfaces and integrations for numerous components.
    - Offers a basic runtime for combining these components into chains and agents.
    - Provides off-the-shelf implementations of chains and agents.

2. **LangChain Templates:** 
    - A collection of readily deployable reference architectures catering to a wide array of tasks.

3. **LangServe:** 
    - A library designed for deploying LangChain chains as a REST API.

4. **LangSmith:** 
    - A developer platform facilitating debugging, testing, evaluation, and monitoring of chains built on any LLM (Language Model) framework.
    - Seamlessly integrates with LangChain.
